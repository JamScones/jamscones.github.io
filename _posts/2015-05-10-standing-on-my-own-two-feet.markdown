##Making the choice

I’ve always wanted to have a business and work for myself, it was my dream certainly by the time I was in secondary school. Of course life isn’t that simple and I’m quite a risk adverse soul so there always seemed to be a good reason not to do it: You’re in school and if you don’t go to Uni you might not look good to employers, you’re out of uni and if you don’t get a job you might not be able to in the future, you’ve got a job but if you don’t get on the housing ladder you might find yourself priced out (at the time the housing boom was going on). Then one day I took a look at my life and thought; “If you’re not going to do it now, you’ll never do it!”

##What’s the plan

For a long time I’ve had a good idea what would be my ideal enterprise: a online web service of some sort, selling a consumer service to a large number of individuals, lots of self service to keep manual administration to a minimum, employ a small team of high quality individuals to work with. The ideal thing would have low running costs and should essentially make money on it’s own, human effort should only be required to develop new stuff or possibly drive new business (although I’m of the impression if you’re doing things right things sell themselves).

So I’ll just go do that then! …. well … no. You have an idea? Well that’s great but how long is that going to take to implement? Are you doing a day job so you can eat in the mean time? Do you intend to have a social life? Once you’ve implemented your idea is anyone actually going to pay for it?

For the last few years I’ve had a very comfortable job that I think I’ve performed pretty well at. I’ve also had a very busy social life which kept me busy most evenings and weekends. Over the last couple of years I would say I reached the top of where I could go in my job (to be clear I mean "job" not "career"). My initial thoughts were to try and seek out better pay either in the organization or outside it because ... that is just what you’re supposed to do, isn't it? But then when I looked at it I realized I didn’t need more money, the thing I really lacked was time.

I found the answer whilst looking for a software contractor for a project I was managing for my employer: if I worked as a day rate IT contractor I could change the ratio between free-time and income. So my plan started to look like this:

* Aim to spend about 9 months in the year doing freelance software contracting
* Use the remaining time to bootstrap your own ideas.

My hope is these will compliment each other quite well. Think technology X is cool and will really help your productivity? Well, learn it in the off time and you’ll not need to convince anyone but yourself that it’s the right thing to do.

##Making the leap

I had a 3 month notice period at my employer. If you’re looking at getting a 3 month contract on a software development project, no one is going to wait 3 months to hire someone for 3 months. They’ll want someone who can start soon. So I decided to make sure I had enough to live off, and then hand in my notice and pay out the term.

I also used this time to try and sort out some of the admin stuff that needs to happen:

* I got a LTD setup. If you’re doing contracting, classically you either setup a limited company or you go through a umbrella agency. The umbrella companies big sell seemed to me to be that they take the administration of running a company out of it for you and just PAYE you your money. Personally I wanted to get involved in having a LTD because I felt that fitted in with my long term better.
* I got a accountant and a bank account. Company tax law looks complicated, I don’t want to break the law, and everyone I spoke to told me getting a good accountant was a no brainier.
* Setup some basic stationary: logo, business card, email, website. I didn’t spend much time on these, but they felt like things you have to have be taken seriously.

##What’s next?

* Get some ground work done on my web service ideas
* Learn some new skills
* Find a first contract!

Should be fun!
