"You've got to specialise" an ex-colleague told me this many years ago, I don't remember what triggered it but I do remember feeling a little surprised, disappointed, and a bit of afraid.

I'd never considered myself very good at learning and then remembering every minunite of a single subject, I tend to remember the stuff I think I'll need and remember how to work out or look up the rest. So I didn't think I'd be able to specialise in that way, especially not in the field I was in at the time which felt pretty small. My mind helpfully pointed out that ultimately in this new world I would lose, because there will always be people who are able to specialise in that way and thus make my ability to 'work it out' irrelevant, 'cause that other one just knows it. Also, it continued, this would only get worse as I got older, specialising more and more into an increasingly small field whilst relying on a memory that could get increasingly shakey.

That triggered something else, as a child in Scotland I remembered my father talking to a local. The local was upset about the decrease in engineering jobs (the kind with metal) and consequently his future. I thought to myself, maybe in this specialised world I wouldn't get the luxury of being employed until someone with a better memory replaced me, maybe the whole field would become irrelevant.

When I was too young to be employed I felt like I could do anything and
