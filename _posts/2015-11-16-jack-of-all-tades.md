"You've got to specialise" an ex-colleague told me this many years ago, I don't remember what triggered it but I do remember feeling a little surprised, disappointed, and a bit of afraid.

I'd never considered myself very good at learning and then remembering every minunite of a single subject, I tend to remember the stuff I think I'll need and remember how to work out or look up the rest. So I didn't think I'd be able to specialise in that way, especially not in the field I was in at the time which felt pretty small. My mind helpfully pointed out that ultimately in this new world I would lose, because there will always be people who are able to specialise in that way and thus make my ability to 'work it out' irrelevant, 'cause that other one just knows it. Also, it continued, this would only get worse as I got older, specialising more and more into an increasingly small field whilst relying on a memory that could get increasingly shakey.

That triggered something else, as a child in Scotland I remembered my father talking to a local. The local was upset about the decrease in engineering jobs (the kind with metal) and consequently his future. I thought to myself, maybe in this specialised world I wouldn't get the luxury of being employed until someone with a better memory replaced me, maybe the whole field would become irrelevant.

But, it was also a surprise. I'd never specialised before and it hadn't been a problem. Actually it felt like quite the oppersite. The start of my career had been in a very small company (4 people when I joined). In that situation there isn't really an option on specialising or not, everyone needs to be as flexible as possible, there isn't room for strong dedications to a particular field, the thing will sink whilst you're reading about some subtle point about particular configuration examples.

My colleague was right about my immediate situtation; at that time with that employer there was a strong push to push everyone into very narrow specialisms. This led to odd little upsets, I can think of several people who resented being told to stop doing a bunch of stuff they were doing previously and focus on very narrow fields instead. They were unhappy for all sorts of reasons, some worried they're role reduction was part of a longer term attack on them personaly, aimed at erroding their role to the point where they were redundant. Some people were annoyed at inconvience, some were annoyed because the bit they lost was their favorite part of the job.

It created boundaries, and it became very easy for people to try and shift responsibility/work/blame towards other teams, which in turn led to a complex web of personal trusts and grudges that would invisibily get in the way of just about everything.

Boundaries also have a weird effect on work load.

If you imagine a IT delivery project as if it were a car on an assembly line. Along the assembly line specialized teams each carry out a single function on the project and as the project works it's way along the assembly line it becomes increasingly complete.

Each team is only in use whilst it has a project that at it's point on the conveyor and requires work. Anytime there isn't a project at their station they are idle.

If the project work is ameanable to this way of working, and you arrange the project in a way whichs makes this possible in the first place, then you can reduce the idleness by pipelinging the whole thing which looks attractive but is pretty hard to pull off.

More likely, you'll end up with some manic people (project managers, the teams doing work at the time) and a bunch of people who are waiting for input.

Boundaries also create cracks. Between two fields there's normally a kind of no mans land, and specialists on either side will argue over whose responsibility that area is. Sometimes, it's not even a politcal matter, you need to understand both sides technically to make the thing work; the no mans land should (in this model) be jointly owned.

When I was too young to be employed I felt like I could do anything and whilst I'm now more cautious about jumping into areas that are outside my regular expertise, I'm still happy to do it if it's the right thing to do. Or just interesting enough.

There are also things that are just plain forgotten about, if you're defining a large complex system by ridgedly defining the limits of every component of that system, you're likely to forget some components exist at all, especially if these were in effect hidden from view before because they were a subtle part of someones role.

For me these two areas, cracks and missing parts, were my saviour.
