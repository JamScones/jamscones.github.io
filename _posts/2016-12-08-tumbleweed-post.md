Wow, over a year since I last updated this! Here's an obligitory "I must try harder" post.

What happened in the last year?:
 * End of day rate contracting
 * Rats
 * Fixed price infrastructure work
 * Support contract work
 * Working nomadically staying motivated, tracking time, etc
 * the disturbing rise of nazis
 * Duffa hat
 * Doormouse development
