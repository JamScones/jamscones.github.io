#Backstory

 I'd quit my job to setup a start up. That's the dream and it's all very exciting but dreaming doesn't put food on the table so early on I imposed a condition on myself: "You have a year to prove that you can live this way, otherwise you'll have to be realistic and start considering perment roles again".

Now this year I've got quite a lot of development work done on the startup idea and I feel like I should have something in production that people can buy sometime early in 2016. I'm self funding the enterprise (which is surprisingly rare in startup circles, and really something else I think I should blog about but anyway), when I thought about the challenge I'd set myself it was clear there was only really one way to go: day rate contracting.

First off, I timed my entry into this poorly! I started applying for contract roles around mid-august meaning that I was going for roles at the exact time that anyone who could make a decision was away on holiday. As a result the going was pretty slow right up until September when suddenly the phone started to ring off the hook. Until that happened though I had all the mental self doubt that you might imagine, I didn't realise it was a timing issue until after the event.

#It's very different out there!

My inital fear was that my previous employer were doing things in an out of date way and I was going to get a bit of shell shock when I found everyone was doing it in a better, new, way.

That wasn't it at all. The oddly surprising thing for me was how much variation there was, even before you get to the questions people ask.

At one place, I headed to the interview expecting it to take about an hour, maybe an hour and a half if it was going well, but then actually spend the whole day being interviewed one by one by half the team, then come back on another day to be interview by the other half! On the end of the first day (I didn't know about the 2nd yet) I commented to the final interviewer that it had been the most rigerous and intensive interview process I'd ever seen (we covered a lot of ground on that first day). His reply was insightful and well phrased, frustratingly I can't remember it exactly:

####*Think about how much time you'd spend evaluating which switch or server to buy. A member of staff is going to cost more money, but normally people will spend less time considering that choice.*

This was a far stronger approach than the my long term employer. At the prevous place you have to under go some training before you're allowed to be an interviewer. It's regarded in much the same way as most corporate training is, but I was quite a fan of what it was trying to do. The main messages were:

* don't be a bigot
* think about what you hope to learn from the questions you ask.

They were massively unkeen about the question "Why do you want this job?", personally I think it has a place, but I can also see why they didn't like it: you're often unlikely to like the honest answer ("I wanna get paid" is some how negative), which means everybody will likely lie to you because they want to avoid the honest answer, and whatever they say it very rarely reveals anything about the candidate which will help you make a choice.

Another thing I took away from them; it's better to ask questions in a way that help the candidate show the best of their ability, than to treat it like a competition and aim to ask trick questions to try and catch people out. For a lot of people it's already a stressful situtation and whilst you'll likely find people who handle that style of question well, you may have found one of the other candidates would have been a better fit.
A more common approach is to try and weed out some people with a pre-interview phone call, TODO

TODO this next bit follows poorly

Some people seem to be happy to make a jugdement over the phone. I don't mean merely dismissing someone over the phone; talking on the phone is all they need to evaluate someones suitability!

Some places did an initial screening call with a few simple questions, then maybe a practical test, then a face to face for some more in depth questioning.


#Practical tests

Interestingly tests were both much less prevelant than I expected (I thought they'd be nearly ubquitous for the contracts I was applying for), and much fairer than I expected. I expected obsecure and hard with no access to realistic tools like Google, instead in general people seemed to allow access to Google if the task would normally require it (who doesn't Google unfamilar error messages?). One place I applied did this entirely Online which I thought worked pretty well; you just go to the url when you know you'll have the time spare, answer the questions, logon to and fix the specified VM for the practical. Very tidy setup.

I'm the past I've been involved in recruitment panels, and I've seen situations where members will avoid asking technical questions for fear they won't be able to compare the relative answers that candidates give. It's difficult to remember exactly what someone said and recording interviews is likely to put peoples backs up. On the other hand I can't think of anyone half way competent who would login to a test VM and then think it was unacceptable that their bash history would be reviewed after the test, so maybe that's a good answer to that scenario?

The best practical tests I saw gave a bunch of core things you needed to do, then a bunch of optional extras. They were also obviously structured in such a way that getting stuck on problem one didn't stop you skipping ahead and doing something worthwhile on problem 2. I also came across tests that gave *way* more work than could reasonably be achieved in the timeframe which I thought was pretty good; how does the candidate prioritise work?

#Questions

So I've seen interviews happen where people have tried to appoint people for a highly technical roles without asking many deep technical questions, it's a dangerous game.

TODO TODO TODO

####Good

* *"Explain as fully as you can what happens when you visit a web page"*

####Bad

Bad questions, in my opnion, are ones that don't really tell you anything useful about the candidate. I think a lot of the time people instinctively feel they need to ask difficult questions that tie the candidate up in knots. Questions that leave you open to being bullshitted are also poor in my view; if you ask lots of questions where it's possible to give a bullshit response you'll probably end up working with the best bullshiter. However, maybe that's useful to you, who knows. Here are some examples of what I think are poor questions:

* *"List 10 two letter linux commands"* - I'm sure I know over 10 two letter commands, I suspect I know quite a lot over 10. I've never been in a situation where I've needed to internally index linux commands by length. What would that even look like? "Quick the server is down and the console will only let us type lines two characters long ... "? When faced with this question I couldn't even remember "rm", but if you'd asked me "How do you delete a file on linux?" that answer would have come to mind very quickly.
