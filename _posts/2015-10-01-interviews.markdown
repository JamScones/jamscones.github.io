Backstory: I'd quit my job to setup a start up. That's the dream and it's all very exciting but dreaming doesn't put food on the table so early on I imposed a condition on myself: "You have a year to prove that you can live this way, otherwise you'll have to be realistic and start considering perment roles again".

Now this year I've got quite a lot of development work done on the startup idea and I feel like I should have something in production that people can buy sometime early in 2016. I'm self funding the enterprise (which is surprisingly rare in startup circles, and really something else I think I should blog about but anyway), when I thought about the challenge I'd set myself it was clear there was only really one way to go: day rate contracting.

First off, I timed my entry into this poorly! I started applying for contract roles around mid-august meaning that I was going for roles at the exact time that anyone who could make a decision was away on holiday. As a result the going was pretty slow right up until September when suddenly the phone started to ring off the hook. Until that happened though I had all the mental self doubt that you might imagine, I didn't realise it was a timing issue until after the event.

It's very different out there!

My inital fear was that my previous employer were doing things in an out of date way and I was going to get a bit of shell shock when I found everyone was doing it in a better, new, way.

That wasn't it at all. The oddly surprising thing for me was how much variation there was, even before you get to the questions people ask. For some places I'd head to the interview expecting it to take about an hour, maybe an hour and a half if it was going well, but then actually spend the whole day being interviewed one by one by half the team, then come back on another day to be interview by the other half!

Some people seem to be happy to make a jugdement over the phone. I don't mean merely dismissing someone over the phone; talking on the phone is all they need to evaluate someones suitability!

Some places did an initial screening call with a few simple questions, then maybe an online test, then a face to face for some more in depth questioning.

Online tests

Interestingly online tests were both much less prevelant than I expected (I thought they'd be nearly ubquitous for people like me), and much fairer than I expected (I expected obsecure and hard with no access to realistic tools like Google).
