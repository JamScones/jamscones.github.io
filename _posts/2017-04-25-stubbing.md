# Stubbing: a pattern to break a infinite recursion situation whilst serializing data.

Recently I hit a problem with JSON serialiation in a project where I was using Java with Jackson for object serialization. 

In the data model, I found I had pairs of classes that had bidirectional relationships. Here is an example:

```
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Building {
	List<Room> rooms = new ArrayList<Room>();
	public List<Room> getRooms(){
		return rooms;
	}
	public void setRooms(List<Room> rooms){
		this.rooms = rooms;
	}
	String name = null;
	public string getName(){
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name){
		this.name = name;
	}
}

public class Room {
	Building building = null;
	public Building getBuilding(){
		return building;
	}
	public void setBuilding(Building building){
		this.building=building;
	}
	String number = null;
	public String getNumber(){
		return number;
	}
	public void setNumber(String number){
		this.number = number;
	}
}
	
```

Jackson struggles with this; processing the list of Rooms in a Building, recursing through each Room to the original Building, which trigers another attempt to process the Room list, and so on until an Exception occurs.

This recusion can be broken by using the @JsonIgnore annotation. To do this, one adds the annotation to an attribute they are happy to not have serialized to JSON, thus breaking the recusion cycle. To do this, we could change our Building class like so:

```
...
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;

public class Building {
	List<Room> rooms = new ArrayList<Room>();
	@JsonIgnore
	public List<Room> getRooms(){
			return rooms;
	}
	public void setRooms(List<Room> rooms){
		this.rooms = rooms;
	}
	String name = null;
	public string getName(){
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name){
		this.name = name;
	}
}
```

This works pretty well, but sometimes I'll want to see the Room list in the Building JSON. One alternative is to move the @JsonIgnore annotation so that it's on the Building reference inside the Room class. However if one wants to also be able to see the Building associated with a Room from the Room's JSON then this is no better.

The solution I picked in the end, was to introduce a BuildingStub class with most of the Building attributes but without the Room list, then I modified the Room class to hold a reference to the BuildingStub rather than the Building:

```
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class BuildingStub {
	String name = null;
	public string getName(){
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name){
		this.name = name;
	}
}

public class Building extends BuildingStub{
	List<Room> rooms = new ArrayList<Room>();
	public List<Room> getRooms(){
		return rooms;
	}
	public void setRooms(List<Room> rooms){
		this.rooms = rooms;
	}
}

public class Room {
	BuildingStub building = null;
	public BuildingStub getBuilding(){
		return building;
	}
	public void setBuilding(BuildingStub building){
		this.building=building;
	}
	String number = null;
	public String getNumber(){
		return number;
	}
	public void setNumber(String number){
		this.number = number;
	}
}
	
```

In this example, there is no recursion at serialization time and we have a way to serialize a Building and include a list of Rooms, whilst at the same time being able to see some information about a Building from the serialized data of a Room.

A Building can be cast down to a BuildingStub with relative ease:

```
	room.setBuilding((BuildingStub) building);
```
To convert a BuildingStub into a Building a helper method could be added, for example to the BuildingStub class itself:

```
public class BuildingStub{
...
	public Building toBuilding(List<Room> rooms){
		Building building = new Building();
		building.setName(this.name);
		building.setRooms(rooms);
		return building;
	}
}
```
